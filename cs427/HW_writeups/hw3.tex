\indent This assignment took approximately 5 hours to complete. No additional files or methods were implemented. \\
\indent Currently the shading on the circles is slightly off. Each output will have a small section near the edges that have an unusual
white shading. I'm not sure why this is, but I would have to guess that it is a result of an incorrect intersection point being sent. Besides this one small section, I believe the
rest of my methods have been implemented correctly.
