 \indent This homework took me around 25 hours to complete. Scene 8 is not completely correct and scene 9 is not correct at all. The
 reflection color for scene 8 is not fully there, meaning that the color that is being multiplied is not correct. The recursion
 for scene 8 is done in a while loop instead of true recursion, this was simply because I thought it was easier to implement.
 In scene 9, evaluation is not totally correct.
