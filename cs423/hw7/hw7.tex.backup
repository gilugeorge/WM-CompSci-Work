 \item (20 points) Problem 2.30 (a) and (d) on page 131.
  \begin{description}
   \item a) Use the pumping lemma to show that the following language is not context free: \\
	    $A = \{0^n1^n0^n1^n | n \geq 0\}$ \\
	Assume $A$ is context free. The pumping lemma applies. Let $p$ be the pumping length. Let string $s = 0^p1^p0^p1^p \in A$
	and $|s| \geq p$ with $s= uvxyz$, $|vy| > 0$ and $|vxy| \leq p$ and $\forall i \geq 0$, $uv^ixy^iz \in A$. \\
	Pumping $s$, all $p$s must be equal or a $p`$ that is different from $p$ will result, rendering $s \notin A$. Therefore,
	$\forall i \geq 0$, $uv^ixy^iz \in A$ is true if and only if none of the $p$s change or $p$s change in $0^p1^p0^p1^p$.
	Since $|vy| > 0$ and $|vxy| \leq p$ the substring $vxy$ can be:\\
	1. one $p$ and a maximum length of p. \\
	2. at most 2 $p$s no matter where $vxy$ spans $0^p1^p0^p1^p$. \\
	Therefore, when $i=0$, and $s=uxz$, there will be one or two $p$s and $s \notin A$. This is a contradiction, proving that $A$
	is not context free.
   
   \item d) Use the pumping lemma to show that the following language is not context free: \\
	$B = \{t_1\#t_2\#\dots \#t_k | k \geq 2, each t_i \in \{a,b\}*, and t_i = t_j for some i \neq j\}$ \\
	Assume $B$ is context free. The pumping lemma applies. Let $p$ be the pumping length. Let string $s = a^pb^p\#a^pb^p \in B$
	and $|s| \geq p$ with $s= uvxyz$, $|vy| > 0$ and $|vxy| \leq p$ and $\forall i \geq 0$, $uv^ixy^iz \in B$. \\
	Let $i = 0$:
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item[Case 1:] $vxy$ is contained in the first $a^pb^p$. With $s = uv^0xy^0z$, there are fewer symbols on the left of the $\#$
	      than on the right. Thus $s \notin B$.
	 \item[Case 2:] $vxy$ is contained in $b^p\#a^p$. With $s = uv^0xy^0z$, there are fewer $b$s on the left side and fewer $a$s on
	      the right side. Thus $s \notin B$.
	 \item[Case 3:] Similar to case 1, $vxy$ is contained in the second $a^pb^p$. With $s = uv^0xy^0z$, there will be fewer symbols
	      on the right of the $\#$ than on the left. Thus $s \notin B$.
	\end{itemize}
	Since within each case $s \notin B$, there is a contradiction, proving that $B$ is not context free.
  \end{description}

 \item (10 points) Problem 2.32 on page 131. (Hint: The following selection of s won't work: $s=1^p2^p3^p4^p$. Try other block orders.) \\
      Assume $C$ is context free. The pumping lemma applies. Let $p$ be the pumping length. Let string $s = 1^p3^p2^p4^p \in C$
	and $|s| \geq p$ with $s= uvxyz$, $|vy| > 0$ and $|vxy| \leq p$ and $\forall i \geq 0$, $uv^ixy^iz \in C$. \\
	Let $i = 0$:
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item[Case 1:] $vxy$ is within $1^p$, $2^p$, $3^p$, or $4^p$. With $s = uv^0xy^0z$, there could be a $p'$ that does not have 
	      equal number of values. Thus making $s \notin C$.
	 \item[Case 2:] $vxy$ spans $1 \to 3$, $3 \to 2$, or $2 \to 4$. $1 \to 3$ would cause a different number of $1s than 2s$ as well as
	      $3s and 4s$. $3 \to 2$ would cause a different number of $3s than 4s$ as well as $2s than 1s$. $2 \to 4$ would cause a different
	      number of $2s than 1s$ and $4s than 3s$. Thus however the string is seperated, $s \notin C$.
	\end{itemize}
	Since all cases result in $s \notin C$, there is a contradiction, proving that $C$ is not context free.
	
 \item (10 points) Problem 2.42 on page 131. (Hint: $s=1^{p+1}\#1^{p+2}\#...\#1^{3p}.$)
        Assume $Y$ is context free. The pumping lemma applies. Let $p$ be the pumping length. Let string $s = 1^{p+1}\#1^{p+2}\#...\#1^{3p}
        \in Y$ 	and $|s| \geq p$ with $s= uvxyz$, $|vy| > 0$ and $|vxy| \leq p$ and $\forall i \geq 0$, $uv^ixy^iz \in C$. \\
        Let $i = 2$ for Case 1, $i=0$ for Case 2, and $i = 3$ for Case 3:
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item[Case 1:] If $v$ or $y$ contains only 1s, is within a block of 1s, or is along two sets of 1s from $1^{p+1}$ to $1^{2p-1}$.
			Since $|vxy|$ is bound by $|p|$ and $|vy| > 0$, $uv^2xy^2z$ will be reproduced again in a $t_j$.
	 \item[Case 2:] f $v$ or $y$ contains only 1s, is within a block of 1s, or is along two sets of 1s from $1^{2p}$ to $1^{3p}$.
			
	 \item[Case 3:]
	\end{itemize}

 
\end{enumerate}
