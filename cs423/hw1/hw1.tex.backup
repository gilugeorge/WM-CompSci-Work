\begin{enumerate}

\item (5 points) Prove by induction that for all integers $n \ge 4$ the inequality $2^n < n!$ holds.

\item (5 points) Prove by contradiction that $2 - \sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number. \\
We know that any any sum of a rational and irrational number is irrational, so we will first focus on  $\sqrt{2}$.
To prove by contradiction we first assume $\sqrt{2}$ is a rational number.
\begin{center}
 $\exists$ int a, b with $gcd(a,b)=1$, such that $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$\\
 $\implies$ $2=\frac{a^2}{b^2}$ \\
 We then find the greatest common denominator (gcd) of a and b. \\
 $\exists k$ $a=2k \implies (2k)^2=2b^2$\\
 $\exists l$ $b=2l$ \\
\end{center}
 From this, we deduce that the $gcd(a,b) \geq2$, which contradicts the fact that $gcd(a,b)=1$, and proves $\sqrt{2}$
 irrational. Therefore if $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, $2 - \sqrt{2}$ is irrational by the properties of irrational 
 numbers.



\item (5 points) Find the error in the following proof that all horses are the same color. \\
There is an incorrect claim when $H_1$ is presented as having $k$ horses. 

\item (5 points for each question) Give state diagrams of DFAs recognizing the followiing languages. In all parts the alphabet is $\{0,1\}$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item[a.] $\{w|w$ begins with a 1 and ends with a 0$\}$
\begin{center}

\item[e.] $\{w|w$ starts with 0 and has odd length, or starts with 1 and has even length$\}$
\begin{center}

  d = odd, e = even

\item[i.] $\{w|$ every odd position of $w$ is a 1$\}$

\end{enumerate}

\item (5 points) Give the state diagram of a DFA that recognizes (accepts) the set of strings such that in each string the number of 0s is divisible by 5 and the number of 1s is divisible by 3.
