  \item (7 points) Exercise 4.3 on page 183. \\
    A decidable language is closed under the complement. TM $M_{\bar{L}}$ which decides $\bar{L}$ will accept when TM $M_{\bar{L}}$ that
    decides $L$ rejects, and reject when $M_{\bar{L}}$ accepts. It has been shown that $E_{DFA}$ is decidable where $E_{DFA}$ = $\{<A> | $
    is a DFA and $L(A)= \emptyset \}$. \\
    On input $<A>$ where $A$ is a DFA:
    \begin{enumerate}
     \item Mark the start state of $A$.
     \item Repeat until no new states are marked.
     \item Mark states that has a transition coming in from any state that is already marked.
     \item If no accept state is marked, accept. Otherwise, reject.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item (7 points) Exercise 4.6 on page 183. \\
    Proof by contradiction. Assume that $B$ is countable. Infinate sequences over ${0,1}$ can be represented by $N = {1,2,3,...}$. A
    $f(n)$ can be mapped where $n \in N$. $f(n) = (w_{n1},w_{n2},w_{n3},...)$ where $w_{ni}$ is the $i$th bit in the $n$th sequence. Using
    diagonalization, it is possible to find a sequence over ${0,1}$ that is not in $f(n)$, where the $i$th bit is the opposite of the $i$th
    sequence. This means that the sequences are $\notin$ $B$, giving us a contradiction, proving $B$ to be uncountable. \\

    \begin{array}{l|l}
     $n$ & f(n) \\ \hline
     $1$ & (w_1 1, w_1 2,w_1 3,w_1 4,...) \\
     $2$ & (w_2 1, w_2 2,w_2 3,w_2 4,...) \\
     $3$ & (w_3 1, w_3 2,w_3 3,w_3 4,...) \\
     \vdots & \vdots

  \item (7 points) Exercise 4.7 on page 183. \\

  To prove that T is countable we provide a function f : T → N. Given a triple (i, j, k)
from T f is deﬁned as follows: convert each number i, j, and k to their respective binary
representation. We will compute the natural number n in its binary representation. For
the ath bit of n, we divide a by 3. This will produce a quotient q and a remainder r.
If r is 0 then we extract the qth bit from i, if r is 1 then we extra the qth bit from j,
if r is 2 then we extract the qth bit from k. Note that if the qth bit of i, j, or k is not
deﬁned then use a 0. Note that f maps every i, j, k tuple to a natural number and every
natural number can be converted to an i, j, k tuple (by the reverse process). Hence f is
a one-to-one function and onto (aka a bijection). Therefore T is countable.

  \item (7 points) Problem 4.19 on page 184. \\
  *reference www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~gusfield/cs120f11/HW6key.pdf* \\
  
  For this problem, we want to show that S is decidable. To show this we construct a TM T such that T on input < M > does the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item Construct a DFA N that recognizes L(M )R 1.31.
   \item Run TM F from Theorem 4.5 on < M, N >, where F is the TM deciding EQDF A
   \item If F accepts, accept. If F rejects, reject.
  \end{enumerate}





3. If F accepts, accept. If F rejects, reject.

Note that for any language A, let AR = {wR |w ∈ A}. Observe that if < M >∈ S then
L(M ) = L(M )R . So F will accept < M, N > ⇐⇒ L(M ) = L(N ) = L(M )R . Hence
M will accept ⇐⇒ L(M ) = L(M )R . Therefore M is a decider for S and thus S is
decidable.
  
  \item (12 points) In class, we learned that $A_D$ is non-TR, $A_{TM}$ and $HALT_{TM}$ are TR but non-TD. What can you say 
	about their complements? Are they non-TR, TR but non-TD, or TD? Justify your answers.
