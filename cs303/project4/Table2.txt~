[Single Run]

[Replace this second block with the name of the machine in the CS
system on which you ran your timing tests (e.g., bg1 or ...).  If your
tests were run on a machine not on the CS network, then say so and
indicate the features of the machine upon which your tests were run.]

[Replace this third block with the list of options you used to compile
and create the executable used to run your timing tests.  In
particular, it is useful to know if you used compiler optimizations.]

[Finally, if you elect to leave one of the entries as "NA" (as
discussed in the project specifications), then replace this last block
with a thorough, but succinct, explanation of why.]
